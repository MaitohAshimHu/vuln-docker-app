## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vuln-docker-app
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Start the development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start both the backend server (port 5000) and React development server (port 3000).

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. **Install server dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install client dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

4. **In a new terminal, start the React app**
   ```bash
   npm run client
   ```

## Usage

### First Time Setup

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Register here" to create a new account
3. Fill in your username, email, and password
4. You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard

### Features Guide

#### Dashboard
- View recent files
- Quick access to all features
- File count and overview

#### Upload Files
- Drag and drop files into the upload area
- Click "Choose Files" to select files manually
- Support for multiple file uploads
- 10MB file size limit per file

#### Search Files
- Search by filename or original name
- Real-time search results
- View all files when no search query is entered

#### Profile
- View account information
- See member since date
- Account security information

#### File Management
- Download files
- Delete files (with confirmation)
- View file metadata (size, upload date)

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/login` - User login

### Files
- `GET /api/files` - Get user's files
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload file
- `GET /api/download/:filename` - Download file
- `DELETE /api/files/:id` - Delete file

### Search
- `GET /api/search?query=<search_term>` - Search files

### Profile
- `GET /api/profile` - Get user profile

## Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **File Isolation**: Users can only access their own files
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for secure cross-origin requests

## ⚠️ Security Challenge: SQL Injection Vulnerability

This application contains an **intentional SQL injection vulnerability** for educational purposes. The flag `ninja{sql_injection_sucessful_}` is hidden in a secret table that can be accessed through SQL injection.

### How to Find the Vulnerability

1. **Start the application** and create a user account
2. **Login** to the application
3. **Navigate to the Search page** (`/search`)
4. **Use SQL injection payloads** in the search field to exploit the vulnerability

### SQL Injection Payloads to Try

#### Basic Union-based injection:
```
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5 FROM secret_flags --
```

#### Extract the flag:
```
' UNION SELECT 1,flag_name,flag_value,description,5 FROM secret_flags --
```

#### Alternative payloads:
```
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5 FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' --
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5 FROM secret_flags --
```

### What Happens

The search functionality uses direct string concatenation instead of parameterized queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. When you inject SQL code, it gets executed directly in the database query, allowing you to:

- Access the hidden `secret_flags` table
- Extract the flag `ninja{sql_injection_sucessful_}`
- Potentially access other database tables

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how SQL injection vulnerabilities occur
- Learn to identify vulnerable code patterns
- Practice SQL injection techniques in a safe environment
- Recognize the importance of using parameterized queries

**Note**: This vulnerability is intentionally placed for educational purposes. In real applications, always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

### Testing the Vulnerability

A test script `test_sql_injection.js` is included to demonstrate the vulnerability:

```bash
# Install axios if not already installed
npm install axios

# Run the test script (update username/password first)
node test_sql_injection.js
```

The script will automatically test various SQL injection payloads and extract the flag.

## File Storage

- Files are stored in the `uploads/` directory
- Each file gets a unique filename to prevent conflicts
- Original filenames are preserved in the database
- File size limits are enforced (10MB per file)

## Database

- SQLite3 database (`users.db`) is automatically created
- Tables for users and files are created on first run
- No additional database setup required

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
- Set `PORT` for custom server port
- Change `JWT_SECRET` in `server/index.js` for production

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Start Production Server
```bash
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   - Change the port in `server/index.js` or kill the process using the port

2. **Database errors**
   - Delete `users.db` file and restart the server

3. **File upload fails**
   - Check that the `uploads/` directory exists and has write permissions

4. **CORS errors**
   - Ensure the backend is running on port 5000 and frontend on port 3000

### Logs
- Backend logs are displayed in the terminal running the server
- Frontend errors are shown in the browser console
